## Welcome to chongkai.site

I am research student at The Hong Kong Polytechnice University. My research interest are in computer vision and deep learning.

This is my personal website, covering the [collections](https://chongkai.site/docs/collections/), [posts](https://chongkai.site/docs/posts/) and other interesting things I collected.

### Have a look

Currently, the most meaningful thing in this site is the [Pytorch Practices](https://chongkai.site/docs/collections/pytorch_practice/), which contains all pytorch tips I found.

### Contributing
If you found any mistakes or want to post your contribution, pls [create a new issue](https://github.com/makecent/makecent.github.io/issues/new) in the github page repo. PR is also welcomed.
