## Welcome to chongkai.site

I am currently a postdoc researcher of Otolaryngology Department, Eye & ENT Hospital of Fudan University. My research interests are in artifical intelligence.

This is my personal website, which covers my [collections] (https://chongkai.site/docs/collections/), [posts] (https://chongkai.site/docs/posts/), and other interesting things. 

### Have a look

Currently, the most meaningful thing on this site is the [Tips of Terminal](https://chongkai.site/docs/collections/useful_cmd/) and the [Pytorch Practices](https://chongkai.site/docs/collections/pytorch_practice/).

### Contributing
If you found any mistakes or want to post your contribution, pls [create a new issue](https://github.com/makecent/makecent.github.io/issues/new) in the github page repo. PR is also welcomed.
