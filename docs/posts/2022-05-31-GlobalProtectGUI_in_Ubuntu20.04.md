# Download the package file
I cannot directly provide the download link because of the license issue. You may find the package file by your self

# Decompress the file
```shell
tar -xvf PanGPLinux-5.2.6-c18.tgz
```

# Install the GUI version
```
sudo dkpg -i GlobalProtect_UI_deb-5.2.6.0-18.deb
```

# Open the GUI
The GUI will automatically launch after the installation completed, but will not persist. To reopen the GUI, run the command:
```shell
globalprotect launch-ui
```
