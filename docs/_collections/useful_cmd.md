du -hs ./datasets
```
#### Create and delete files

```shell
touch foo.txt
mkdir a_folder

rm -r a_folder
```

tar -xvzf a_folder.tar.gz  # uncompression

   ``-a``: keep file information, including owners, permissions, etc. \
   ``-h``: make output human-readable. \
   ``--no-i-r``: scan files before copying, rather than at the same time. Faster when lots of files. \
   ``--info=progress2``: display a progress bar. \
   ``--dry-run``: perform a trial run that doesnâ€™t make any changes (and produces mostly the same output as a real run). \
   ``source`` and ``destination``: the source file/folder and destination folder. \
   ``source/``: If a trailing slash added, the **content** in ``source`` will be copied into the ``destination``. So if ``destination`` doesn't exist or is empty, this works like a combination of copy and rename.
